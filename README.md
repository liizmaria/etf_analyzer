# ETF Analyzer
Financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.


## Technologies

This project was developed with python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.

* [HoloViz (formerly PyViz)](https://pypi.org/project/hvplot/) - Data visualization tools hvPlot and GeoView.

* [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) - NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.

* [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy) - SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. 
* 
And as well I used [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) notebook to develope it.
